(ns median-degree.graph
  "namespace manages graph of venmo transactions
  stores graph in atomic vector of median-degree.schema/VenmoTX structs.
  this gives a complete description of graph with directionality and 
  additional data to drive edge eviction.
  Graph mutation operations are perfomed on edge-list representation
  as our main focus is adding edges and evicting them based on edge metadata
  edges are stored as sets of node identities that serve as keys to edge metadata"
